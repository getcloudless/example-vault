# Configuration options for the blueprint testing framework.
#
# This file describes configuration for the blueprint test runner, which can
# create, verify, and cleanup services based on a blueprint, providing a
# deterministic way to test the way instances actually behave in a deployment.
# See https://docs.getcloudless.com/ for more details.

# Configuration for service creation.
create:

  # Number of instances needed for the test.
  count: 1

  # Blueprint file to use to create test service.  This is the default.
  blueprint: blueprint.yml

  # This is a fixture that describes any pre setup (e.g. necessary services that
  # this service being tested needs to run) and post setup (e.g. adding the
  # right firewall rules) that needs to be done to properly test this blueprint.
  # These are the defaults.  See blueprint_fixture.py for more details.
  fixture_type: python-blueprint-fixture
  fixture_options:
    module_name: blueprint_fixture

# Configuration for service verification.
verify:

  # This happens to be the same fixture, but for verify this is the code that
  # tests whether the running service is behaving as expected.  These are the
  # defaults.  See blueprint_fixture.py for more details.
